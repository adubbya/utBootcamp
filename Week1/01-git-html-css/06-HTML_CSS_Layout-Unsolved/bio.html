                    I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Douche chill! I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Talk you off what, Pop Pop?

                    Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! You might enjoy this. Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing.
                    
                    Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? Let's see some bananas and nuts!
                    
                    No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. This was a big get for God. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy.
                    
                    A million [bleep]ing diamonds! You can always tell a Milford man. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? And the soup of the day is bread.
                    
                    I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? Let's see some bananas and nuts! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON.
                    
                    Those are balls. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. Oh, COME ON! There are dozens of us! Dozens! In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? And I am rock steady. No more dizzies.
                    
                    Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. Say goodbye to THESE!
                    
                    If that man's straight, then I am sober. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Daddy horny, Michael. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers!
                    
                    The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!" A night of heterosexual intercourse.</p>
